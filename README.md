# Operating System 

Using operating system APIs (specifically, the POSIX API in Linux) and concurrency directives to implement a process and memory management system. Asuccessful implementation will have multiple process queues (which use the principles of bounded
buffers), a memory model, and two different page replacement algorithms (FIFO and Not Recently Used) Implementing both page replacement algorithms will enable you to simulate and compare their
efficiency.
